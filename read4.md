In today's blog, I am going to talk about some topics in **HTML**. _So, let's get started!_

### 1. Process and Design in HTML:
There are several ***Important*** questions to consider when designing a website, some are described as follows:
* Who will visit my website?
* Why will they visit my website?
* What information they are looking for?
* How often will they visit my website?

After answering these question, a developer starts to organize the information into sections or pages. This is done by the following methods: 
* ##### Site Maps: a diagram of the pages used to structure the site. It shows how those pages can be grouped.
* ##### Wireframes: a simple hierarchy sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. 

In particualr, ***communication*** is the primary goal of visual design. Communication can be successfully accomplished by _prioritizing, organizing, and carefully choosing the content of the page._
For instance, the developer should consider the features of _visual hierarchy, grouping and similarity,_ including details like (_size, color, style, images etc.._).

### 2. Structure in HTML:
**HTML** is maily used to structure the web page, it uses elments to describe the structure of pages.
To do this, HTML used ***tags*** as building blocks. These tags might contain features named _attributes_. They are used to provide additional information about the contents of an element.
There are several parts of the _HTML_ page:
* `<head>`.
* `<body>`.
* `<footer>`.
* `<title>`.

### 3. HTML5 Layout:
Alongside with `<div>` tag used to divide parts of the webpage, _HTML5_ have introduced new elements for the layout. The following are examples of these elements:
* `<header>` and `<footer>`: appears at the top and bottom of every page on the site.
* `<nav>`: used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site.
* `<article>`: acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
