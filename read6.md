In today's blod I'm going to talk about ***JAVASCRIPT***, an intersteng programming language used in web development. _So, let's get started!_

### 1. How HTML, CSS, and Javascript fit together?
* HTML: content layer `.html`.
* CSS: presentation layer `.css`.
* Javascript: behaviour later `.js`. Can also be written inside the html file with the tag `<script>'.
These 3 layers form what is called **Progressive Enhancement**.

### 2. Basic Javascript instructions:
Here, I'm going to summarize some basic concepts and instructions related to _Javascript_.
* **Script:** a series of instructions followed by a computer to accomplish a task.
* **Statement:** a single instruction used in the script. A group of statements form a script.
* **Comments:** explaines what the code does, ignored when executing. `\\`, `\*`.
* **Variables:** containers of information defined by a unique name. `var x = 3`.
* **Datatypes:** can be `string`, `boolean`, `int`, `numeric`,etc..

The following are some basic rules to name a variable in JS:
1. must begin with a letter, `$`, `_`, not with a number.
2. can contain letters, `$`, `_`, and numbers.
3. cannot use keywords or reserved words.
4. names are case-sensitive.
5. should describe the info it contains.
6. does not contain spaces.
