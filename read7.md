In today's blog, I am going to discuss some topics related to ** Programming in Javascript**. So, _let's get started!_

### 1. What is a _Script_, and how to write one?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow step-by-step to achieve a goal, Just like recipes, handbooks and manuals. Then, a browser can use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the webpage.

To write a script, the developer need to first state goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed to achieve it. In other words, the developer must Start with the big picture of what he wants to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps, as the following:
  1. Define the goal.
  2. Design the script: using **flowcharts or steps**.
  3. Code each step: each step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be _written_ in a language the computer can understand and follow.
  
  In conclusion, for someone who wants to learn a programming language, he must start learning how to think like a computer. Then, get fimiliar with the **vocabulary** and **syntax** of the language.
