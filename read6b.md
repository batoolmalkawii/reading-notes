# Explore the tech!
In today's blog, I am going to introduce you to the ***how computer works*** and  in the _simplist_ way possible. So, _let's get started!_

### 1. What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
The computer was originally invented to help humans in the thinink work they do, and were designed to manipulate information.
Basically, the computer needs to pass 4 main stages in its work, that are common to all computers:
1. Taking input.
2. Storage.
3. Processing.
4. Producing output.
And this is what makes a computer, ***a computer!***
