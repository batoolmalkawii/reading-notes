# Explore the tech!
In today's blog, I am going to introduce you to the ***how computer works*** and  in the _simplist_ way possible. So, _let's get started!_

### 1. What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
The computer was originally invented to help humans in the thinink work they do, and were designed to manipulate information.

Basically, for a machine to be a computer, it needs to perform 4 main stages in its work, that are common to all computers:
1. Taking input.
2. Storage.
3. Processing.
4. Producing output.
And this is what makes a computer, ***a computer!***

### 2. Binary and Data:
Simply, 1s and 0s have a big role in how a computer work, _on the inside_. In every computer, there are **wires and circles** that carry all the information.
Bit is the smallest piece of information that a computer can store. whcih means that if we want more bits, we use more wires to represent them in `0s` and `1s`. The more bits you use, the more complex information you can represent.

The computer uses the **binary number system** that uses only 2 digits, `0s` and `1s`. Using these 2 digits, any number can be represented. Furthermore all kinds of graphics are originaly bits of `0s` and `1s`. 


### 3. Circuits and Logic:
Each input and output on a computer represents some kind of information that can be written as `0s` and `1s` in the computer language which originally converts from or on and off of an electric wire.
These millions of tiny electric components used to process inputs and outputs form what is called a **circuit**. A circuit can be simple, which performs single operation, or complicated, which takes multiple signals and combines them to give different results. Examples of simple circuits are the operations of `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`, etc..


### 4. CPU, Memory, Input & Output:
* **Input:** converts physical input into binary information.
* **Memory:** stors information.
* **CPU:** calculates information.
* **Output:** converts information into ohysical output.

### 5. Hardware and Software:
* **Hardware:**
  + circuits.
  + chips.
  + wires.
  + speakers.
  + plugs.
  + etc..
* **Software:**
  + apps.
  + games.
  + websites.
  + maps.
  + analysis.
  + etc..
Hardware and Software interact with each other using the circuits of the CPU.
