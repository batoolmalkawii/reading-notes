I am going to discuss how a developer chooses the right text editor. Also, I'll provide a summary on how to use the command line and file systems in Linux OS. So, let's get started!

### 1. Choosing A Text Editor:
Simply, a text editor is a software used to write and manage texts. In particular, it is used to manage code written for building websites. 
However, how should web developers choosed their appropriate text editor? well, there's no fixed rule that defines the right editor. For me, I think that the editor choise is a _purely_ personal choise that depends on the developer himself. Taking into account some important features that should be included editors that'll make the deveopler's life **easier**, summarized as follows:

* Code completion.
* Syntax highlighting.
* Variety of themes 
* Extension. (to expand the features of the editor if needed).

### 2. Command Line:
Alongside with the Graphical User Interface, Linux offers the use of the OS terminal (command line) for text-based interaction with the system using a variety of commands.
Opening the command is done by going to Application - Utilities - Open in terminal.
To define how the terminal will behave and look after executing commands, the ***shell*** is used. 
To make your life easier, the Linux command line is full of shortcuts that will save you from making typos and mistakes!

### 3. File System:
There are several commands in the terminal used to move around the system and its files. The following are examples of these commands:
* `pwd' -  _Print Working Directory_.
> tells you what your current or present working directory is.
* `ls' -  _List_.
> lists the content of the directory.
* `cd [location]' -  _change directory_.
> changes the directory that is accessed by the terminal.

Let's keep in mind that Linux treats everything as a file, literally everything! directories, keyboards, monitors  and so on.. 
So, an extension system used to distinguish every file type from the other. examples of these extensions are: `.exe`, `.txt`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.jpg`.
However, Linux concluds the file type be reading the file itself, not by the extension. So, to know a file type in linux, you can use the `file [path]` command in terminal.

***Note that the command line in Linux is case sensitive, so make sure you type the file name right!***
