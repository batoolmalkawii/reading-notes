# Explore the tech!

In this blog, I am going to explain some concepts used the tech world, especially in the web development industry. I'll try to make it as simple as I can, so _be patient!_

#### 1. What is _Markdown_?
Markdown is a method used by developers to style the web page and spice it up a bit! the beautiful thing about this technique is its simplicity. For example, I am using it right now to make this **word** bold. Magic, isn't it? actually no. What I did is that I inserted a (\**) sign before and after the word. Another example is if I want to make a tick list, I'd insert (\[x]) before the sentence if it's tickedm and (\[ ]) if not. The result will look like this:
- [x] Done.
- [ ] Undone.

Let's try another one, suppose you want to make an unordered list of items, what you do is that you inset a (\*) before each line and it'll automatically convert into a bullet. Check this:
* Fruits.
* Vegetables.
* Fish.

Interesting, isnt it? to dig deeper into this topic, check out [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
Youy're probably asking yourself how did I added the previous link. well guess what? I also used _Markdown_! 
First, I put **Mastering Markdown** between brackets ([]), this represents the text I want to click on. Then I put the actual URL between paranthesis ( ). 

This is how I wrote it: \[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)



#### 2. What is _GitHub Pages_?
So, suppose you're a developer, and you created a website that you're amazingly _proud of_, and you wanted to share your work with your colleagues anf friends, **GitHub Pages** is the right tool for such a thing.
Simply, **GitHub Page** is a place to share and publish work of developers, by creating a store for the code called _Repository_ that can be published using a unique URL.
