# **Growth Mindset** 

Dweck described a growth mindset as: 
> “In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.”

For me, a person with a growth mindset is someone who believes in the power of practice, working hard, effort, and focus. After I was intoduces to the concept of **Growth Mindset**, I understood the verse in the **_Holy Quran_** that says: 
> "***And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for- (39), And that his striving shall soon be seen- (40), Then shall he be rewarded for it with the fullest reward- (41)***"

Since then, I've decided to keep reminding myself with the following:
1. Turn failures into lessons.
    * past mistakes are keys to avoid in order to fasten your future success.
    * trials are practice.
2. It is ***Okay*** not to be perfect.
    * be flexible to yourself so you can move faster. 
3. Uniqueness + practice = Masterpiece!

In conclusion, a growth mindset should be this:
- [x] Embrace challenges.
- [x] Persists obstacles.
- [x] Learns from critisizm.

and ***not*** this:
- [ ] Avoids challenges.
- [ ] Loses focus from obstacles.
- [ ] Ignores critisizm.
