In this website, you'll find various topics realted to web development _explained in a simple, neat way!_

But first, let me introduce myself to you guys! 

My name is ***Batool Malkawi***. I am a _masters_ graduate from the _University of Jordan_ in the major of _Computer Science_.

I've been working in _Data Science_ research for the past two years. Mostly, I worked in _Clustering, Community Detection, Distributed systems and Computational Performance_.

Currently, I'm working my way to become a _Software Development Engineer_ who is passionate and motivated to create something, _Inshallah!_

A fun fact, I love to skate in my free time, I barely have free time though!
